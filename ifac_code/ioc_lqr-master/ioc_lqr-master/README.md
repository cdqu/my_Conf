# Inverse Optimal Control

Inverse reinforcement learning or inverse optimal control problem.

This is the case for exact recovery of LQG case. Formulated as an SDP problem, solved by YALMIP solver.

The code is loosely based on "Solutions to the Inverse LQR Problem With Application to Biological Systems Analysis", 
IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CONTROL SYSTEMS TECHNOLOGY, 2015
